My personal entry for Pyweek 20, a work in progress
(cf  https://pyweek.org)
More Data is Required

It will be a 2D topdown game where the player controls a little robot 
who needs to collect data in order to have more information on how 
to save his crew from imminent disaster.

Using Python 3.2.5 with pygame 1.9.2, 
currently using PyScripter to work, will test on other machines later
